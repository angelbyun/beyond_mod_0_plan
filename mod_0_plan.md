- Kaitlyn provided us a link this morning to practicing more code. I plan on utilizing this website to be able to look at more code, find what could be wrong it, and fixing it.
- I will be changing my work space. I purchased a standing desk for my work space to help with not sitting all day. I will also be setting up my second monitor because this week was a little rough using just one.
- I want to also enjoy the next couple of weekends feeling refreshed. I will be snowboarding in the mountains with my friends. I will also make sure I spend quality time with my close cousins.
- I think closer to the start of Mod 1, it is important that I take a look at the Google Calendar to make sure that I am prepared for anything that we need to get done before the first day, any apps that may need to be downloaded, if we need to meet with anybody.
- I am so happy that I have gotten close to everyone in my small group. I will continue to go onto Slack and message them, check up on them, make sure they are doing okay. I have also taken time to get to know Kelly, my eval partner, and I also want to make sure I am checking up on her. She also lives in Colorado! So I told her when we have time, we must meet up for a puppy playdate!
